				<strong>ACADEMIC PROJECTS</strong>
				<br><strong>Selected Course Project: Advanced Stochastic Processes, CSU East Bay, 2015 Spring Quarter</strong> [R]
				<br>Self-selected project on disease simulation.  Used R to simulate spread and death rates of a disease given their reproduction rate.  Graphical displays were produced to spatially analyze spread.  Markov-chain queues were used to simulate an infection rate factoring in a vaccination rate.  Grade received: A; professor impressed with how well-written the paper was and the effective use of graphs.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Selected Course Project: Advanced Statistical Inference, CSU East Bay, 2014 Fall Quarter</strong> [R, Minitab]
				<br>Collaborated with 2 classmates to collect data of NFL running backs (rookie) season data. Used graphical and inferential statistical methods to analyze data. Specifically, carried out 1-way ANOVA and regression analysis. Result: Conclusive: more passing attempts led to more yards per carry. Presented data to class, explaining process, conclusion, purpose of study, and findings in addition to numerous graphs & charts. Grade received: A; professor impressed with thorough knowledge, organization, and presentation skills.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Selected Course Project: Coursera Online Course – Introduction to R</strong> [R]
				<br>Final project involved big data using Hospital Compare mortality and readmission rates taken from Medicare database.  Created R scripts with the purposed of ranking hospitals by mortality rate with mortality rate type, and state of residency as factors.  Devised system that allowed script to account for ties in the rankings.  Included modified ranking system that retrieved the “best” and “worst” hospitals per state.  Project received full credit upon completion.
